# Abstract

To make content more accessible to the student readers, XRDS has recently launched its new mobile app. The app will enable Android and iOS users to browse the magazine on the go from their Android or iOS enabled smart phones or tablets.Each issue of XRDS features a theme, such as" The Role of Academia in the Startup World" or" Big Data," with coverage of research trends and interviews. Students can also read timely updates on upcoming major conferences, grants, fellowships, and contests. Even better, students can now get all this in a more convenient wayâ€”their hand-held devices.
