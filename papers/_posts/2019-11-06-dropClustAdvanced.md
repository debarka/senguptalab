# Abstract

DropClust leverages Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to speed up clustering of large scale single cell expression data. Here we present the improved dropClust, a complete R package that is, fast, interoperable and minimally resource intensive. The new dropClust features a novel batch effect removal algorithm that allows integrative analysis of single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets.
