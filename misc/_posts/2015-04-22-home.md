At Sengupta Lab, we make use of state of the art Big Data mining and Machine Learning techniques to address computational challenges arising from the field of Genomics.

We closely collaborate with clinicians at leading hospitals to build better predictive models for cancer survival, drug resistance in infection and label-free identification of circulating tumor cells.
