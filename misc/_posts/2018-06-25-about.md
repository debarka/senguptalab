# Design and Implementation

<!--The website is maintained by [Priyadarshini Rai] and [Shivam Sharma]. We were inspired by [Trevor Bedford] lab website which eventually lead me to copy many aspects of his site, from visual layout to content organization, at Trevor's [public] invitation.-->

The website is maintained by [Priyadarshini Rai] and [Shivam Sharma]. We adapted many aspects of [Trevor Bedford] lab website, at Trevor's [public] invitation.

The site started with Jekyll, and was up and running in a week. The site is deployed using GitHub Pages.

The site's source code is freely available on [GitHub].
